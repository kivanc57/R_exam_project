#On the contorary, the least favourable places are Azul_Beach_Club, Prambanan and GiliTrawangan_FreeDive with 2.
# It is relatively obvious for the most of people in case of Prambanan since the scale is from ~1.5 to 4.
#The highest varience is in GiliTrawangan_FreeDive.
#However, for the other places, variance is the highest. Meaning that, there is not a significant agreement among people voted.
#On the other hand, the there is one person that voted "significantly high" that we can see as 10 and 9 in Bali_Safari and Prambanan respectively.
#Those are outliers.

#Logistic regression: Gender and Prombanan would not have correlation. p-value ≈ 0.682135 so p-value>5%
#Logistic regression: Gender and Azul_Beach_Club have correlation. p-value ≈ 0.005184 so p-value>5%
